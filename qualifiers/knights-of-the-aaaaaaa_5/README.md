## Write-up
We are given a file with what appears to be a flag format but in really weird font. This reminded me of a childhood book I used to read about being a spy, so I search up [pigpen cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigpen_cipher). Seems like this is is not the actual pigpen cipher but a variant of it by the knights. So we set out to decrypt it.

Therefore, the flag is `CROSSCTF{LINK_FOR_YOU}`.
